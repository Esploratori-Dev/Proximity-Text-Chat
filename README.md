# Bedrock Proximity Text Chat
Hello! Ever wanted to have proximity chat on your server, realm or world? To have players chatting only if they are close enough one to another just like in real life?Then this addon is the solution for you. Super light, easy to setup, simple to use!

**Bedrock Proximity Text Chat** from [Esploratori-Development](https://discord.gg/A2SDjxQshJ) is extremely compact and light, and simply aims to provide this single functionality to your world, by using uniquely scripting.

## Setup
* Enable experiments on your world
* Install the addon
* run `/function proximity/menu` to open the menu

### Chat-Rank
* The messages will appearance will be modelled according to the template: 
 * `$t` rank-rag (starting with `rank:`)
 * `$u` username of the sender
 * `$n` nametag of the sender
 * `$m` message content

## Q&A
* *Does it work also on single worlds and Realms?* Yes, it does!
* *Does it need experiments on?* Yes, in order to work this pack requires experiments on.
* *Can anyone change the proximity-distance?* Yes! and no... When you first install the addon anyone can change it, but you can edit it so that only people with a certain tag can do that. How? read below!
* *Wait, so players can't chat at all?* Well, not entirely, they can still use commands (if they know about them) such as /me, or /say. Still having long chats that way it's pretty hard... much better come closer!
* *Where can I get help?* just come to visit us on the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/A2SDjxQshJ)!
* *Does it work with voice?* Nope, that's voice proximity, and we are still working on it.
